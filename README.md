# SRT-Opening-Fixer

Kinda overkill way to fix a SRT file where the video have the opening but your subtitles does not, so you'll need to sync it.
Just grab when the OP starts, how long it lasts (usually 1m30 ~ 90s), set up the variables, paste the SRT as text in the file (I promise I'll do a better way later) and its done.<br><br>
<b>The variables are:</b>
<br>START: when the OP starts<br>TO_BE_ADDED_MS: how long it lasts in MS (usually its 90000, the default)<br>OUTPUT_PATH: file to save it (default will be in the app folder)
<br><br>Kinda a personal project but freel fee to use it :)
