# SRT-Opening-Fixer

Kinda overkill way to fix a SRT file where the video have the opening but your subtitles does not, so you'll need to sync it.
Just grab when the OP starts, how long it lasts (usually 1m30 ~ 90s), set up the variables and paste the SRT files in the input folder at the root level.<br><br>
<b>The variables are:</b>
<br>START: when the OP starts<br>TO_BE_ADDED_MS: how long it lasts in MS (usually its 90000, the default)<br>INPUT_PATH: Where to read files from<br>OUTPUT_PATH: Where to save it (default will be in the output folder at root level)
<br><br>Kinda a personal project but freel fee to use it :)
